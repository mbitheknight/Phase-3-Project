# Predicting the Condition of Tanzanian Water Wells: A Machine Learning Approach to Maintenance and Sustainability

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the condition of water wells in Tanzania to address challenges related to clean water access. By classifying wells as functional, non-functional, or in need of repair, the project helps stakeholders prioritize resources and enhance the sustainability of water points.

## Problem Statement
Access to clean water remains a critical issue in Tanzania, especially in rural areas. Many wells are either non-functional or require maintenance, impacting the well-being of communities. This project builds a machine learning model to predict well conditions, aiding in efficient maintenance planning.

## Methodology
Following the **CRISP-DM methodology**, the project involved:
1. **Business Understanding**: Define objectives to classify well conditions for better resource allocation.
2. **Data Understanding**: Analyze key features such as geographical location, population, and construction year and many others.
3. **Data Preparation**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, solving class imbalance and scale numerical features.
4. **Modeling**: Develop and evaluate Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models (both untuned and tuned).
5. **Evaluation**: Assess models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
6. **Deployment**: Prepare the final model for real-world use to support decision-making.

## Data Description
The dataset contains numerous columns, but the following 17 features were selected and used in the machine learning model:
- `Quantity`, `Longitude`, `Latitude`, `Waterpoint_Type`, `Gps_Height`, `Construction_Year`, `Subvillage`, `Day`, `Ward`, `Population`, `Funder`, `Extraction_Type`, `Wpt_Name`, `Amount_Tsh`, `Lga`, `Installer`, and `Status_Group` (target variable).

## Recommendations
1. Refine features to capture patterns more effectively while ensuring proper dataset labeling.  
2. Expand datasets with accurate labels for better validation.  
3. Explore advanced models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.  
4. Use labeled datasets for consistent evaluation of key performance metrics.

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the tuned Decision Tree model after integrating labeled datasets for testing.  
2. Continuously update datasets with labels for iterative model refinement.  
3. Explore ensemble techniques for further performance improvements.
